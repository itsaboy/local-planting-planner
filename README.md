# Local Planting Planner

## Description

https://itsaboy.github.io/local-planting-planner/

This is a website using 2 APIs to find location and Hardiness Zone.  The site displays a map of all the zones, and produce/plants safe to plant in the user's area. There is an input for the user to type in their zip code which will determine which climate zone, the time of year to plant annuals and perrenials, and a sample of what plants are local.


## Usage
After reading about the Hardiness zone the zip code can be entered into the search box. If it has been entered before, a red box will appear saying it is in the history. If that is the case you can look for the location in the history. This has been stored in the local storage. After entering a zip code a second page will appear showing the zone number, when things should be planted and what plants are local to the area.
